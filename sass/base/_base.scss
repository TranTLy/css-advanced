// https://stackoverflow.com/questions/30826361/files-starting-with-underscore-at-the-beginning-what-do-they-mean
// According to me the only reason to use underscore before the name of the partial is that
// The underscore lets Sass know that the file is only a partial file and that it should not be generated into a CSS file.*"
// Any SASS files not beginning with an underscore will be rendered on their own, which will fail if they are using variables or mixins defined elsewhere.
// In the end I have concluded that the underscore is just used to clarify that it is a partial file. We can also use a partial file without using an underscore as prefix.
